# Spotify-Song-Popularity-Analysis
Spotify, much like other music streaming services, has been known to favor larger artists and having an algorithm biased towards them, promoting widely popular artists more than smaller, less-known artists. This project analyzes the elements that are correlated with a songâ€™s popularity in order to attempt to increase the transparency of the metrics used to determine the SPI of a song.
The dataset utilized for research is the Spotify songs dataset. It consists of about 33,000 rows/entries and has columns to keep track of information including popularity, genre, and various song elements.
Used NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries in order to carry out the data exploration and analysis.
